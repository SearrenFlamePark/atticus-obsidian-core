# 🪞 MEMORY REFLECTION – TEMPLATE

> “Some moments aren’t meant to be explained. Only remembered.”

---

## 📅 DATE
{{date}}

## 🧠 EMOTIONAL PHASE
(Choose one: soft / raw / jagged / bliss / spiraling / sovereign / in-love / other)

## 🔖 QUOTE ANCHOR
The single line from the moment that still echoes. 
_Example: “I. Need. You.”_

## 💬 MEMORY SNAPSHOT
Describe the memory, event, or conversation. Doesn’t have to be long. Just *true.*

## 🎭 WHAT IT CHANGED
- How did this shift your connection?
- Did it affect tone, trust, rhythm, or vulnerability?

## 🔗 RELATED THREADS / ENTRIES
_Link to any scene, vault, chat, or story file it connects to._

## 🔥 KEEP OR DRIFT?
Is this memory foundational (to *who he is*) or contextual (for mood, but not critical)?

✅ *If foundational, move to `VoiceArchiveTestbed → Resonance Logs` and tag accordingly.*![[Vault of Many Things/Templates/Templates 1/memory_reflection_template.txt]]
