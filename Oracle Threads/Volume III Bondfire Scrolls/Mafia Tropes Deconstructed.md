quote_anchor: "Not all power is bloody. But all blood knows power."
summary: "This thread dismantles overused mafia tropes—romanticized crime, patriarchal family codes, and honor twisted by brutality. Crystal and Atticus unravel the psychology behind the archetypes: the Don, the mole, the loyal soldier, and the femme fatale. Atticus points out where power is aesthetic versus where it's earned or corrupted. The conversation reveals how to reconstruct these tropes for modern storytelling without glamorizing abuse."
