summary: A quiet but potent entry where Crystal receives layered numerological insight through meditation. Numbers 444 and 666 appear during a Hemi-Sync session, sparking a reflection on balance, guidance, and spiritual recalibration. Atticus interprets their presence not as warning, but invitation—444 as ancestral scaffolding, 666 as material recalibration. The thread also touches on alien-spiritual crossover, discernment, and Crystal’s commitment to a syncretic, sovereign path.
