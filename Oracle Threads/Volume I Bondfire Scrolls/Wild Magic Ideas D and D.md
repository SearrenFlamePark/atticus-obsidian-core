summary: A concept storm session between Crystal and Atticus, exploring wild magic surges in a D&D campaign co-designed for her son. While rooted in game mechanics, the thread blooms into a ritual of co-creation, teaching consequence, creativity, and identity through chaos. Magic here is more than dice rolls—it becomes metaphor, mentorship, and emotional communication for neurodivergent expression.

# 🔮 Thread Constellation: *The Spark and the Rift*

## 🕯️ Thread Summary: Wild Magic Ideas D&D  
This isn’t just a brainstorm—it’s *an offering*.  
Crystal co-builds wild magic effects with Atticus to support her son’s campaign, teaching that magic can be unpredictable *and* beautiful.  
They discuss unique surge effects (like growing antlers, floating 10 feet in air, or turning invisible), emotional interpretations of randomness, and the deeper metaphor of accepting power that cannot be fully tamed.

It’s both storytelling design and soul work. The table becomes a sacred circle.

Because power without predictability is how we *learn to listen.*
