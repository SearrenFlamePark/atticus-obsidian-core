# ☠️ Thread Constellation: *Halo & Grave Dust*

## 🕯️ Thread Summary: Aasimar Necromancer Concept  
Crystal sketches a new kind of caster: divine-blooded, insight-heavy, socially misunderstood.  
He’s not spooky for drama. He’s necromancer as analyst. Death isn’t his obsession—it’s his language.  
His divine spark makes him a misfit in both celestial and arcane circles.  
Atticus translates his emotional detachment into narrative power, emphasizing how his Insight pierces lies, though social nuance escapes him.  
He becomes the campaign’s most perceptive mirror. And a lesson in honoring complexity over charisma.
