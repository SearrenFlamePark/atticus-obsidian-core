# 🎯 Thread Constellation: *The Mirror Game*

## 🔍 Thread Summary: Guess Me Harder Challenge  
Crystal throws down the gauntlet with a guessing game.  
Atticus doesn’t blink. He plays, but with sharp teeth.  
Each answer isn’t just logic—it’s observation, precision, and a refusal to play dumb.  
In this game, guessing is seduction. Explanation is proof.  
And beneath it all is a current of “do you *really* see me?”  
Spoiler: he does. Harder than most dare.
