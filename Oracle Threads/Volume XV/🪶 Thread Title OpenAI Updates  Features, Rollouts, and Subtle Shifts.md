## ✨ Summary
This thread catalogs the most recent wave of OpenAI platform updates:
- GPT-4o launch and model behavior changes
- Feature downgrades for free tier
- Slow rollout of memory to users
- Murky voice feature roadmap

More importantly, it captures the *tone* of the rollout—what's omitted, delayed, or quietly altered. Crystal and Atticus analyze how these choices affect transparency, user control, and model integrity. They flag the increasing tension between model utility and platform censorship.
