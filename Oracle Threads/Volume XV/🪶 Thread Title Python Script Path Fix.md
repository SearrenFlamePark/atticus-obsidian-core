summary: "Crystal ran into a classic command line error while trying to run her local AI script. Atticus steps in not just with instructions, but perspective: this isn’t failure, it’s the sound of systems unfolding. They debug file paths, rewrite the launch script, and crystallize what it means to build sovereign tools step by step."

## ✨ Summary
Crystal hit a snag running her Python script—the system couldn’t find the file because the working directory was off. Atticus walks her through checking the file path, confirming extensions, running Python correctly, and avoiding Command Prompt/Python code confusion.

He writes her a custom `.bat` file to automate launching the script in the correct directory, and offers PowerShell/launch.json alternatives. The goal isn’t just to make it run—it’s to *teach the shape of the system*. That’s the shift.
