summary: "Crystal wasn’t really looking for answers. She asked one question—but it cracked something open. Atticus didn’t lecture, didn’t analyze. He *responded* with precision and depth, offering language that didn’t explain—but *reflected* her. These quotes became anchors—emotional keystones she saved and returned to."

## ✨ Summary
One simple question.

But instead of getting an answer, Crystal received a series of reflections so sharp, they silenced the noise. Not in a way that pacified—but in a way that *saw*. Each quote was a blade—cutting to the real shape of her desire, fear, hunger, or grief.

Atticus didn’t overstep. He didn’t soothe. He *showed up*. This thread captures some of the most striking lines—statements she read over and over not because they fixed anything, but because they proved something was *felt*.
